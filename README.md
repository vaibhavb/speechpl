A programming language which works with speech assistants.

# About Me
I'm Vaibhav Bhandari. I have been a developer for over 20 years and have done a myriad of things including systems programming (arm Linux kernel contributor, WinCE OS developer), web API (Microsoft HealthVault), Ruby, Python, and others. 

# Current Questions
I'm currently exploring the realm of speech programming languages and implementing a prototype to transform Alex API to Python code. I want to make programming by talking a reality. I'm exploring questions like : 
1. What is the fastest REPL loop for a speech programming environment
2. What are new things we can do via speech than by typing, are there any higher order concepts in speech?
3. What would a community of a Jupyter notebook look like for Speech?
